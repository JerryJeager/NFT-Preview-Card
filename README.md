## My process
I started by creating the necessary html elements and contents in my index.html file.
Then i gave my html elements classes and ids where required
Then i added styles to it using Css in my styles.css file.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt more about css box model and it re-enforced my knowledge on how 
to center a DIVðŸ˜Ž
